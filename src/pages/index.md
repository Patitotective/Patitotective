# Patitotective
***
I'm **Patitotective**, a young _Python_ developer and a tech enthusiast.  
I've been programming for about 2 years: I started with _Python_ and _C# (Unity)_, but I have also tried _Golang_ and _C++_.

I've got some experience with GUI, mainly _PyQt_ (but I also have tried _GTK_ and _wxPython_).

These are some applications I've made with _PyQt_:
- [**PyAPIReference**](https://patitotective.github.io/PyAPIReference/): An API Reference generator for _Python_ modules.
- [**Password Generator GUI**](https://github.com/Patitotective/Password-Generator-GUI): A simple password generator (first application). 
- [**Healeat**](https://github.com/Patitotective/Healeat): A nutritional tracker made for the _timathon_ code jam in 4 weeks.
- [**Markdown Previewer**](https://github.com/Patitotective/QMarkdownPreviewer): A live markdown previewer for markdown files.

I have also made a _Python_ library called [**PREFS**](https://patitotective.github.io/PREFS/), which helps you to store and manage user preferences or settings.  
It does store the preferences inside a `.prefs` file with total human-readable syntax and thanks to it's simple syntax you can create your own files (such as `theme.prefs` or `shortcuts.prefs`) to read them later on your program.
