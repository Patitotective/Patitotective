Why I haven't posted anything in the last two days? Well, I forgot to. Or so...

## Why I didn't post a blog on...

### November 27
The previous Saturday (27 of November) I was "translating" my previous **Clockside**'s code that was made with _wxPython_ library to use _PyQt5_ library.  
Why? _wxPython_ (as I said in the [previous blog](./first)) supports native GUI (GTK on Linux, OSX on MacOs and Window on windows...) which means that wxPythonâ€™s widgets were being adjusted to fit each platform's GUI. For example, if I create my own widget or change the style of an existing one, it wouldn't look good on different platforms (unless I detect what platform the application is being ran on and change the style, but that would be too much work and I'm not sure if it will work). So I decided to use _PyQt_ because I can customize it to fit my needs.
And I forgot to write a blog (and I was tired).

### November 28
That day I went to my grandma's house and I got caught by THE INTERNET (I was his hostage so he didn't let me work), and my willpower was just enough to do my daily study (what do you study? Blog about it soon).
So I just played [arras.io](https://arras.io/) and watched [Faline videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVLw9wKPHxdBbboXEduN5jA).

## Clockside
As I said I'm "translating" _wxPython_ to _PyQt5_, but I'm struggling with the layout part so I decided to give a try to _Qt Designer_ which is like an application to design the GUI for your _Qt_ application, so you can position and make the widgets look as you like and then in your code connect signals and so (buttons, etc.)  

In tomorrow's blog I will share how I felt with it and how it is going (looking).

I'm not going to create **Clockside**'s guide yet because I need to finish the application and think how to organize the guide.
